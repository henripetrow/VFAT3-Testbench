2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-1584#1 Error
GTxE2 PLLLOCKDETCLK can not be REFCLK  
GTXE2_CHANNEL pin eth/phy/transceiver_inst/gtwizard_inst/gtwizard_v2_5_gbe_gtx_i/gt0_gtwizard_v2_5_gbe_gtx_i/gtxe2_i/CPLLLOCKDETCLK cannot be driven by a clock derived from the same clock used as the reference clock for the CPLL, including TXOUTCLK*, RXOUTCLK*, the output from the IBUFDS_GTE2 providing the reference clock, and any buffered or multiplied/divided versions of these clock outputs. Please see UG476 for more information. Source, through a clock buffer, is the same as the GT cell reference clock.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1584#2 Error
GTxE2 PLLLOCKDETCLK can not be REFCLK  
GTXE2_COMMON pin eth/phy/transceiver_inst/gtwizard_inst/gtwizard_v2_5_gbe_gtx_i/gtxe2_common_0_i/QPLLLOCKDETCLK cannot be driven by a clock derived from the same clock used as the reference clock for the QPLL, including TXOUTCLK*, RXOUTCLK*, the output from the IBUFDS_GTE2 providing the reference clock, and any buffered or multiplied/divided versions of these clock outputs. Please see UG476 for more information. Source, through a clock buffer, is the same as the GT cell reference clock.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>
